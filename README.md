# FOOD TWEAKER

## FEATURES:

* Adjust calories, hydration and Vitamin C of all food items.
* Adjust prepping time, cooking time, re-heating time.
* Adjust how much meat and fish shrinks when cooked 
* Enable MRE self-heating: MRE will become "Hot" after cooking and will provide Warming Up buff when eaten hot
* Enable Warming Up buff for all cooked food items that doesn't already have one (Meat, fish, acorns, & recipes) - can't be re-heated
* Adjust cooking pot multipliers for cooking & boiling time (Recycled Can, Cooking Pot and Skillet)
* Adjust melting/boiling/evaporating time for water


## MOST IMPORTANT WARNING:

Modifying values in one section (Meat/Fish/Drinks/Other food/Recipe) will erase unsaved changes in other sections.
You must therefore :
1 - choose a preset for a section (click on confirm)
2 - modify the values in this section (click on confirm again before moving on to another section).

I'm happy to accept any PR that will improve it.
